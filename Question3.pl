# Write a Perl program that uses a hash and a large number of operations on the hash. For example, the hash could store 
# peopleâ€™s names and their ages. A random-number generator could be used to create three-character names and ages, which 
# could be added to the hash. When a duplicate name was generated, it would cause an access to the hash but not add a new 
# element. Rewrite the same program without using hashes. Compare the execution efficiency of the two. Compare the ease of 
# programming and readability of the two.

# The array seems to be more efficient, it takes 1 less second to execute. The array is also more readable because the commas that separate the elements aren't
# related like in the hash. The has also uses commas but has key value pairs. Arrays have a specific size where hashed
# may not reach the size given to them.
